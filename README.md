# Warframe Task Checklist Web App

A simple, client-side web application to help Warframe players track their daily, weekly, and bi-weekly in-game tasks.

## Description

This tool provides checklists for common recurring activities in Warframe. It saves your progress directly in your browser's local storage, automatically resets daily and weekly tasks based on UTC time, and offers a few customization options.

## Features

* **Task Tracking:** Check off tasks as you complete them.
* **Categorized Lists:** Tasks are separated into Daily, Weekly, and Bi-Weekly sections.
* **Local Storage:** Your checklist progress is automatically saved in your browser's local storage, so it persists between sessions.
* **Automatic Resets:**
    * Daily tasks automatically reset after 00:00 UTC each day.
    * Weekly tasks automatically reset after Monday 00:00 UTC each week.
    * Local reset times are displayed in section headers for convenience.
* **Manual Resets:** Buttons are provided to manually reset Daily, Weekly, or All tasks if needed. Includes a confirmation step to prevent accidental resets.
* **Collapsible Sections:** Each task section (Daily, Weekly, Bi-Weekly) can be collapsed or expanded by clicking its header.
* **Theme Toggle:** Switch between a dark (default) and light theme for the checklist content area. Your preference is saved locally.
* **Rotating Background:** Features a daily rotating background image.
* **Error Handling:** Displays user-friendly error messages within the app (e.g., if saving fails) and allows copying the error details.
* **Responsive Design:** Basic responsive layout using Tailwind CSS.
