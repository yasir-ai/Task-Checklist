# Warframe Task Checklist Web App

A simple, client-side web application to help Warframe players track their daily, weekly, and bi-weekly in-game tasks.

## Repository Updates

This repository will be updated (if changes are made) on the weekly reset (00:00 UTC) to avoid resets to the application hosted on Pages. To avoid any accidental resets of your progress, please fork this repository and host it yourself, or download it and use it locally (and make sure to update it weekly with any changes if needed).

## Description

This tool provides checklists for common recurring activities in Warframe. It saves your progress directly in your browser's local storage, automatically resets daily and weekly tasks based on UTC time, and offers a few customization options.

## Features

* **Comprehensive Task Lists:** Includes common daily, weekly, and bi-weekly tasks.
    * **Collapsible Sections:** Each major section (Daily, Weekly, Bi-Weekly) can be expanded or collapsed for a cleaner view.
    * **Subtasks:** Daily World Syndicate tasks are broken down into collapsible subtasks for specific syndicates (Ostron, Solaris United, Entrati, Cavia, etc.) with linked parent/child checking behavior.
* **Local Progress Saving:** Your checked tasks are saved directly in your browser's local storage, so your progress persists even if you close the tab or browser.
* **Automatic Resets with Local Time Display:**
    * Daily tasks reset automatically after 00:00 UTC.
    * Weekly tasks reset automatically after Monday 00:00 UTC.
    * Section headers display a dynamic countdown timer (e.g., "Resets in HH:MM:SS") showing the time remaining until the next reset in your local timezone.
* **Manual Reset Options:**
    * Buttons to manually reset "Daily Checks," "Weekly Checks," or "All Checks."
    * These buttons feature a two-click confirmation ("Are you Sure?") with a 10-second timeout to prevent accidental resets.
* **Customizable Theme:**
    * Toggle between a dark mode (default) and a light mode for the main content area.
    * Theme preference is saved in local storage.
* **Dynamic Background:**
    * Features a daily rotating background image (currently includes user-provided images and placeholders, with the ability to add more).
* **User-Friendly Error Handling:**
    * Displays clear error messages within the app if issues occur (e.g., problems saving to local storage).
    * Includes a "Copy" button in the error display to easily copy error details for reporting.
* **Responsive Design:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for a generally responsive layout on different screen sizes.
* **Footer Information:** Includes links to relevant resources (GitHub, License, Warframe Hub, Warframe Wiki, FrameHub), app version, and current Warframe version.
